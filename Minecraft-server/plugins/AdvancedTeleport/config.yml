# Determines how and where players teleport when they die.
# Options include:
# - spawn - Teleports the player to the spawnpoint of either the world or specified by the plugin.
# - bed - Teleports to the player's bed.
# - anchor - 1.16+ only, teleports to the player's respawn anchor. However, due to limitations with Spigot's API, it may or may not always work. (add Player#getRespawnAnchor pls)
# - warp:Warp Name - Teleports the player to a specified warp. For example, if you want to teleport to Hub, you'd type warp:Hub
# - tpr - Teleports the player to a random location. Can only be used when the rapid response system is enabled.
# - home - Teleports the player to their main or first home.
# - default - Uses the default respawn option, which is spawn unless set differently.
# If you're using EssentialsX Spawn and want AT to take over respawn mechanics, set respawn-listener-priority in EssX's config.yml file to lowest.

#  Permissions  #
#################

# The default permissions given to users without OP.
# By default, Advanced Teleport allows users without OP to use all member features.
# This allows for permission management without a permissions plugin, especially if a user doesn't understand how such plugins work.
# However, if you have a permissions plugin and Vault installed, you cannot make admin permissions work by default.
default-permissions:
- at.member.*
- at.member.warp.*
- at.member.warp.sign.*
- at.member.core.help
- at.member.core.info

# Allows admin permissions to be allowed as default permissions by default.
# If you want to use admin permissions, it's often recommended to use a permissions plugin such as LuckPerms.
# Do not enable this if you are unsure of the risks this option proposes.

# These work by having a Bedrock player type in the command itself (such as /warp, /tpa, /setwarp), then fill in the rest of the commands through a form.
