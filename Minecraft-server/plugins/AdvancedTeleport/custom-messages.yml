# This messages file uses MiniMessage formatting, a new form of message formatting for newer versions of MC.
# More information about this formatting can be found here: https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html# 
# If you prefer to use the Legacy Code format (i.e. &a, &b, etc.) then you can still use that format.
# 
# It is important to note though that this format may be subject to removal in a future version of AT, however nothing is set in stone yet.
Common:
  # The prefixes for messages, the first element of this list will be usable as <prefix>,
  # with each element after that being usable as <prefix:index> with index being the items index in the list.
  prefixes:
  - <aqua>↑</aqua> <dark_gray>»</dark_gray>
